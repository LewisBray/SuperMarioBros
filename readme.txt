An in browser version of Super Mario Bros. written in JavaScript.  Currently a WIP.

This was heavily inspired by Meth Meth Method on YouTube, the plan is to follow along until the end
of the series and then add in all of the original levels.  Also, I would like to make it multiplayer
using node.js to have Mario and Luigi playing simultaneously at the same time over a network.

I'm really not up to speed with JavaScript but I also have some plans to restructure the code and to
make it more object-oriented and less functional, however using higher-order functions and removing
things like 'for' loops is something I've been wanting to get more comfortable with and so I'm
sticking with it for now.

Currently I'm at the point where the series posted by Meth Meth Method is over, so the next step is
to make at least the first level complete (there is a list of missing features in main.js) before
going on to make it multiplayer and adding in the rest of the levels.
